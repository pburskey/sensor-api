Feature: sensor testing

  Scenario: Sensor Distribution Stable
    Given that I have the following measurements
      | 68.98       |
      | 69.43       |
      | 68.93       |
      | 68.98       |
      | 68.6        |
      | 68.1        |
      | 68.14       |
      | 68.1        |
      | 68.53       |
      | 68.15       |
      | 68.1        |
      | 68.14       |
      | 68.15       |
      | 68.12       |
      | 68.14       |
      | 68.1        |
      | 68.17       |
      | 68.12       |
      | 68.15       |
      | 68.17       |
      | 68.17       |
      | 69.01       |
      | 68.07       |
      | 68.53       |
      | 68.15       |
      | 68.12       |
      | 68.58       |
      | 68.57       |
      | 68.53       |
      | 68.56       |
      | 68.09       |
      | 68.53       |
      | 68.57       |
      | 68.52       |
      | 68.12       |
      | 68.57       |
      | 68.58       |
      | 68.19       |
      | 68.19       |
      | 68.12       |
      | 68.53       |
      | 68.1        |
      | 68.09       |
      | 68.12       |
      | 68.17       |

    Then the standard deviation is < "0.33"
